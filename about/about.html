        <li>Spring 2021: MIT Graduate subject, "Electric Power in the Developing World."</li>
        </br>
        <ul>
            <li>The course presents an in-depth interdisciplinary perspective of the problems, challenges and opportunities of the electric power sector in developing countries, with regulation providing the link among the engineering, economic, legal and environmental viewpoints. The students will understand the political economy choices made concerning the structure and ownership of the power sectors in representative countries, as well as the underlying reasons for the successes and failures. The course examines the complex technical, financial, regulatory, and social challenges of providing universal electricity access in developing countries. The students will learn the adequate supply and demand technologies to meet the energy needs, the estimation of the energy demand, on-grid and off-grid modes of electrification, existing and innovative business models and regulatory instruments, tariff design, consumer preferences and willingness to pay, and electrification planning techniques. Students will make use of optimization models to plan on-grid and microgrid electricity supply. The course will prepare students to contribute to research, technology deployment, and policymaking for the power sector worldwide – with an emphasis of the developing world –as well as for future careers in industry, government, consulting, or multilateral development organizations.
