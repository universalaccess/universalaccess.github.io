    <h1>Inference Tools</h1>
    <p>Large-scale geospatial inference is important for universal energy access research, since ground truth data is rarely available for detailed planning decisions. Among other inference activities, we perform building extraction from satellite imagery and perform probabilistic data fusion to estimate electrification status. </p>

    <h1>Building Extraction</h1>
    <img style="float:right;width:300px;max-width:100%" src="/img/visionpipeline.PNG">
    <p>The limited availability of labeled satellite and aerial image data in rural areas is problematic for many economic development efforts. In these areas, free services like Google Maps and paid commercial suppliers provide great image resources but lack valuable descriptive information. This renders services that rely on such labeled geospatial data not applicable, including services for large-scale infrastructure planning. The goal of this part of our work concerns the accurate labeling of large data sets for use by REM.</p>
    <p>As shown in the figure to the right, the REM model pipeline can be depicted as a series of steps, starting with raw satellite image data that can be augmented with other information. The initial orthorectification, pansharpening, and processing steps convert this raw data into formats usable by our deep learning systems. The object recognition and segmentation step then identifies building boundaries and produces segmentations. These segmentations are input into load localization and characterization algorithms which determine discrete connection points for buildings and provide rooftop area information as a proxy for latent electric load. Finally, the core REM step produces optimal system designs for electrification planning efforts, the data is visualized, and the results are communicated to stakeholders and clients.</p>

    <h1>Inferring Electrification Status with Probabilistic Models</h1>
    <p>The question of where buildings are electrified is problematic for energy infrastructure planning. We are using probabilistic modelling techniquese to infer where people are electrified using data on nighttime lights, coarse existing grid information, and census/survey data.</p>
