    <!--<h1>News!</h1>-->

    <!--<p>We are teaching a new graduate subject at MIT called, "Engineering, economics and regulation for universal energy access in developing countries” in the Fall 2018. Instructors: Ignacio Perez-Arriaga and Robert Stoner.</p>-->

    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p> About 840 million people worldwide lack access to electricity and many more have unreliable access.  Over 570 million in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) lack access to electricity, representing over half of the region’s population. A projected 650 million people are likely to remain without access to electricity in 2030, and 9 out of 10 such people will be in SSA. </p>

    <p> Expedited electrification promises to improve income generation prospects, enable children to study longer, promote improved environmental health (e.g., through decreasing risk of respiratory disease from kerosene light substitution), and improve overall quality of life. Key strategies for closing this gap will include data-based decision-making and advanced policy-planning frameworks, private sector financing, versatile solutions that include decentralized renewables, and efforts to both extend rural electrification and cope with urban densification. </p>

    <p> Decreasing rates of electrification and the scale and complexity of energy poverty motivates stakeholders to `think big' and formulate paradigm-shifting models for improved electricity access. Incremental improvements, while necessary, are not adequate for fulfilling universal electricity access in a timely manner. With this in mind, our research group focuses on two main tasks with the potential to affect large-scale change: (1) the evaluation and recommendation of business models and regulations and (2) the development of infrastructure planning tools for electricity access.  </p>

    <p> We work with decision-makers, large companies, and entrepreneurs in numerous countries to understand regulatory and business model best-practices. We evaluate complex systems affecting energy access through the combination of field experience and academic knowledge from multiple disciplines including economics, law, political science, and engineering. Among other projects, we are currently working with the Rockefeller Foundation as the core research team behind the <a href="https://www.endenergypoverty.org/"> Global Commission to End Energy Poverty</a> (GCEEP). GCEEP’s mission is to forge an actionable consensus among leading investors, utilities, and policy-makers to lay out a viable pathway for cost-effectively and expeditiously providing electricity services to hundreds of millions of under-served homes and businesses. Our approach, termed the Integrated Distribution Framework (IDF), seeks to address the existing problems that cripple incumbent distribution utilities and discourage any further electrification efforts, while integrating off- and on-grid solutions to achieve universal access. </p>

    <p> Technology trade-offs introduce additional complexity with regards to universal electricity access. While most national and state mandates currently focus on grid extension as the main mechanism to close this gap, many experts believe off-grid technologies hold great promise for electrification efforts. Such technologies, including microgrids and isolated systems, may be economically viable in areas where it is prohibitively expensive to expand grid access. Stakeholders interested in promoting energy access require better tools and information to identify the most cost-effective ways to expand access. We have developed the Reference Electrification Model (REM), a computational model which is focused on providing this type of information to help plan detailed electricity networks in developing countries.  </p>

    <p> REM uses information about areas with poor electricity access to determine the best electrification modes (e.g., grid-connected, microgrid, or isolated system) for each household or other load, estimate costs of electrification, and produce preliminary engineering designs of recommended systems. For large regions, REM takes advantage of tools for probabilistic data fusion and inference, which extract the locations of buildings, characterize latent electricity demand, and estimate the current electrification status of buildings using sparse infrastructure data sets, survey information, and satellite imagery. Ultimately, REM produces indicative system designs to inform electrification planning. For smaller regions or single systems, REM can use more accurate information to produce high quality system designs and directly support project implementation.  </p>

    <p> These plans can be used by government planners and off-grid electricity system entrepreneurs to make better decisions about how to plan and implement electrification efforts. We have applied REM with support from multilateral financial institutions to the development of master electrification plans in Rwanda, Mozambique, Papua and Molucca in Indonesia, as well as parts of Nigeria and Peru. We have plans to develop master electrification plans for several Latin American countries as well. </p>

    <p> A spin-off company named Waya has been created by former members of our team. Waya has the exclusive commercial license to use REM and has taken over the task of performing all new electrification planning studies that require the use of REM. They are currently operating in South Asia, SSA and Latin America and are training third parties to use the tool as well. </p>

    <p> Academic research continues on REM-related activities as well. There are some modeling capabilities that need enhancement, like the accurate estimation of upstream reinforcements, the incorporation of more generation technologies, and the identification of multiple generation sites within mini-grids. Electrification planning also requires information about the current electrification status of buildings and we are using probabilistic modelling techniques to infer where people are electrified using data on nighttime lights, coarse existing grid information,census data, and survey data. We also have research initiatives related to demand estimation. Accurately estimating electricity demand is crucial for building the right systems to serve users. Producing better demand forecasts promise to enable better resource allocation, faster returns on investment, and decreased risk for private financing. Once a building structure is identified, inferring its demand for electricity requires its characterization into one of many customer types, each with a range of consumption profiles. We are using machine learning techniques to leverage information from regions where there is abundant demand-related data  and inferring demand in other regions where such data is scarce. We expect that the combination of all these approaches will allow us to execute REM for any low-access country using input data from a general data pipeline that draws from publicly available data sources. The pipeline will consist of models and intermediate data sources for building location identification, demand estimation, electrification status information, existing medium-voltage (MV) and transformer location estimation, and generation, storage, and network catalogs for future infrastructure buildout. </p>
