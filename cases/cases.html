    <h3>2018-2020 Rwanda National Electrification Stratgies and associated Plans (NESP 2024)</h3>
     <p> [<a href="http://www.reg.rw/fileadmin/user_upload/Task_Design_of_the_National_Electrification_Plan_in%20Rwanda_Report.pdf">pdf</a>] The government of Rwanda recognizes the vital role that electricity access plays in accelerating economic development through improving health and standards of living. Energy and particularly access to electricity is Government’s key priority. This is why significant investments have been made and progress registered led to over 40.5% of households getting access to electricity by August 2017 and why the government has set the target of Universal Electrification for the year 2024.</p>
    <p>The aforementioned initiative to extend access to electricity involves a coordinated effort across all power sector participants to connect new customers, focusing also on powering productive activities.</p>
    <p>The first phase of this project defined the “Grid Standard Service Area”. According to the institutional design established by REG – EDCL in the project, this Grid Standard Service Area comprises (a) the customers selected for a connection to the Rwandan Central Distribution Network and (b) the customers that will receive their electricity supply through an isolated grid-compatible microgrid. Outside the Grid Standard Service Area, the least-cost achievement of Universal Access in Rwanda will also require the supply of DC Solar Kits for low-demand residential customers (below 50 Wp as defined by EDCL). It will also determine where a full-fledged stand-alone AC solar system should be provided to larger customers who are too isolated from the network and from other customers to techno-economically justify an individual connection to the central grid or an off-grid microgrid. Per village least-cost choices, designs, a full geospatial database of MV and LV layouts and a complete bill of materials for grid and off-grid systems have been delivered in this first phase.</p>
    <p>The second phase included the development of an Implementation Plan for the MV and LV distribution infrastructure and the on- and off-grid projects that are required to connect additional customers so that universal electricity access can be achieved in 2024. This excludes villages where “densification” (small distance and fill-in connections to the aleady existing grid) is the required electrification mode. In addition to a sound estimation of the investment and operation costs, the results obtained make possible to inform prospective off-grid investors about what areas are not contemplated for grid extension for the temporal scope of the plan (now to 2024). The detailed results of our study will also inform the implementation of the National Electrification Strategy (NES) and of the National Electrification Plan (NEP). The electrification ratios resulting from the Master Plan in this project represent significantly increased efforts compared with the past. This implies a substantial development of additional financial and institutional resources in the future, in particular as rural electrification is extended into more remote areas. The last deliverable report in this phase reexamined the ESSP energy strategy in connection with the institutions responsible for the implementation of the electrification plan. It provides comments on the proposed implementation of the plan and the potential financing alternatives.

    <p>The purpose of the project is to assist the Government of Rwanda to develop a National Electrification Strategy (NES) and related investment plans aimed to achieve universal access to electricity in 2024, meeting adequate and affordable standards on quality of service in a sustainable manner and optimizing the allocation of available resources.</p>

    <h3>Indonesia: Least-cost electrification plan for Papua, Papua Barat, Maluku and Maluku Utara. </h3>
    <p>The Government of Indonesia aims to achieve near-universal electricity access by 2020. Although progress towards this goal has been impressive, approximately 5.9 million households across the country remain without electricity. The provinces of Eastern Indonesia, and in particular Papua, have the lowest electrification ratios in the country and are therefore a focus of the Government’s electrification efforts. Indonesia's electrification push goes hand-in-hand with endeavors towards increasing in the share of renewable generation in the country. In many cases, renewable technologies comprise both the least cost and most sustainable options for the electrification of small islands and remote areas.</p>

    <h3>The South Service Territory in Uganda: Large scale case studies</h3>
    <p>The rural population in Uganda is approximately 84% of the country’s total population (Trading Economics, 2014). The national electrification rate is 15%, and only 7% of the rural population has access to electricity (IEA, World Energy Outlook 2015). As a result, a large focus of the electrification efforts in Uganda is on providing rural electrification solutions. </p>
    <p>The Universal Access Team is interacting with Ugandan rural electrification agencies, utilities, private sector partners, and NGOs to develop a method for providing electricity access to unconnected rural consumers. REM has been used to identify areas of the country most appropriate for certain technologies (i.e. grid extensions, microgrids, or standalone systems). REM will continue to be used in this context for the design of additional infrastructure and reinforcements to accommodate more rapid electrification. </p>

    <h3>Vaishali, Bihar, India: Large scale case studies</h3>
    <p>We are engaged in producing a detailed case study of optimal electrification strategies for the district of Vaishali in Bihar, India. We have worked closely with the local regulators and distribution companies to develop a comprehensive view of the existing infrastructure to inform our use of REM. Vaishali is a mostly agricultural region where many customers remain without electricity access, though the grid has been expanding rapidly in recent years. Nevertheless, grid reliability remains poor, making microgrids attractive in some parts of the district; microgrids may be better able to consistently meet demand at peak times. Preliminary results have suggested that the optimal mix of electrification in Vaishali depends quite heavily on the future reliability of the central grid.</p>
    <p>In order to help us to tune REM and ensure our model parameters are accurate, we are working with Tata Power DDL to build two microgrid pilots in Vaishali. We anticipate construction to start in the coming months and we look forward to seeing the positive impact of this work!</p>

    <h3>Kenya and Colombia: Rural Electrification planning with REM. ENEL Foundation</h3>
    <p>The object of the project is to use the Reference Electrification Model (REM) to establish the potential for microgrid business models in a region of Colombia and in a region of Kenya, subject to the requirements and specifications of ENEL Greenpower. REM will be able to perform objective quantitative assessments about the most convenient way to provide electricity service to each household, comparing together the three major electrification modes: 1) extend the existing grid; 2) build isolated grids with local generation (micro grids); and 3) install isolated stand-alone systems on each target building.</p>
    <p>1. Colombia: A test case will be carried out in a small zone of a peri-urban study region, with around 3,000 unelectrified households, and evaluated by Enel SpA in order to understand the optimal electrification solutions.</p>
    <p>2. Kenya: A test case will be carried out in a small zone of a study region in rural area, with no grid available and around 15,200 households, and evaluated by Enel Green Power in order to understand the optimal electrification solutions</p>

    <h3>Rwanda: Pilot project for electrification of a village in Rwanda taking the local school as the anchor load</h3>
    <p>Advanced methods will be applied to the design of the micro-grid and for the expansion of the number of loads connected to it. Ad-hoc studies will comprise the early involvement of the community in the co-design process, the characterization of sustainable business models and the proposal of a suitable regulatory and enabling environment. Based on the experience gained with the pilot project, this proposal also includes a study to extend the concept to a large number of rural schools (potentially several thousand), either in Rwanda or in another country with similar characteristics.</p>

    <h3>Mini-grids with Thermoacoustic Engine</h3>
    <p>The Thermo Acoustic Power System (TAPS) technology addresses the remote electrification challenge by providing clean, reliable, and maintenance-free power. The TAPS architecture is based on a thermoacoustic engine that improves the Stirling engine with enhanced flexibility and longevity. The architecture is modular in design and benefits from combining several engines to produce a scalable system. The objective of this study is evaluating technically and economically the TAPS technology in comparison to the current generation technologies, i.e. solar plus battery and diesel, in particular when the optimal electrification mode is either the microgrid or the standalone system.</p>
