    <h3>Rwanda: Assisting the government to develop a National Electrification Strategy (NES) and related investment plans. EDCL - World Bank</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the project is to assist the Government of Rwanda to develop a National Electrification Strategy (NES) and related investment plans aimed to achieve universal access to electricity in 2024, meeting adequate and affordable standards on quality of service in a sustainable manner and optimizing the allocation of available resources.</p>

    <h3>Indonesia: Least-cost electrification plan for Papua, Papua Barat, Maluku and Maluku Utara. </h3>
    <p>The Government of Indonesia aims to achieve near-universal electricity access by 2020. Although progress towards this goal has been impressive, approximately 5.9 million households across the country remain without electricity. The provinces of Eastern Indonesia, and in particular Papua, have the lowest electrification ratios in the country and are therefore a focus of the Government’s electrification efforts. Indonesia's electrification push goes hand-in-hand with endeavors towards increasing in the share of renewable generation in the country. In many cases, renewable technologies comprise both the least cost and most sustainable options for the electrification of small islands and remote areas.</p>

    <p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided prior technical assistance to the government on the least cost options for electrification of Maluku-Papua and now is continuing this work by supporting our research on mini and micro-grid development in the region, which will culminate in a formal plan for the region.</p>

    <h3>The South Service Territory in Uganda: Large scale case studies</h3>
    <p>The rural population in Uganda is approximately 84% of the country’s total population (Trading Economics, 2014). The national electrification rate is 15%, and only 7% of the rural population has access to electricity (IEA, World Energy Outlook 2015). As a result, a large focus of the electrification efforts in Uganda is on providing rural electrification solutions. </p>
    <p>The Universal Access Team is interacting with Ugandan rural electrification agencies, utilities, private sector partners, and NGOs to develop a method for providing electricity access to unconnected rural consumers. REM has been used to identify areas of the country most appropriate for certain technologies (i.e. grid extensions, microgrids, or standalone systems). REM will continue to be used in this context for the design of additional infrastructure and reinforcements to accommodate more rapid electrification. </p>

    <h3>Vaishali, Bihar, India: Large scale case studies</h3>
    <p>We are engaged in producing a detailed case study of optimal electrification strategies for the district of Vaishali in Bihar, India. We have worked closely with the local regulators and distribution companies to develop a comprehensive view of the existing infrastructure to inform our use of REM. Vaishali is a mostly agricultural region where many customers remain without electricity access, though the grid has been expanding rapidly in recent years. Nevertheless, grid reliability remains poor, making microgrids attractive in some parts of the district; microgrids may be better able to consistently meet demand at peak times. Preliminary results have suggested that the optimal mix of electrification in Vaishali depends quite heavily on the future reliability of the central grid.</p>
    <p>In order to help us to tune REM and ensure our model parameters are accurate, we are working with Tata Power DDL to build two microgrid pilots in Vaishali. We anticipate construction to start in the coming months and we look forward to seeing the positive impact of this work!</p>

    <h3>Kenya and Colombia: Rural Electrification planning with REM. ENEL Foundation</h3>
    <p>The object of the project is to use the Reference Electrification Model (REM) to establish the potential for microgrid business models in a region of Colombia and in a region of Kenya, subject to the requirements and specifications of ENEL Greenpower. REM will be able to perform objective quantitative assessments about the most convenient way to provide electricity service to each household, comparing together the three major electrification modes: 1) extend the existing grid; 2) build isolated grids with local generation (micro grids); and 3) install isolated stand-alone systems on each target building.</p>
    <p>1. Colombia: A test case will be carried out in a small zone of a peri-urban study region, with around 3,000 unelectrified households, and evaluated by Enel SpA in order to understand the optimal electrification solutions.</p>
    <p>2. Kenya: A test case will be carried out in a small zone of a study region in rural area, with no grid available and around 15,200 households, and evaluated by Enel Green Power in order to understand the optimal electrification solutions</p>

    <h3>Rwanda: Pilot project for electrification of a village in Rwanda taking the local school as the anchor load</h3>
    <p>Advanced methods will be applied to the design of the micro-grid and for the expansion of the number of loads connected to it. Ad-hoc studies will comprise the early involvement of the community in the co-design process, the characterization of sustainable business models and the proposal of a suitable regulatory and enabling environment. Based on the experience gained with the pilot project, this proposal also includes a study to extend the concept to a large number of rural schools (potentially several thousand), either in Rwanda or in another country with similar characteristics.</p>

    <h3>Low-cost energy technologies for Universal Access. Test cases in Cajamarca (Perú) and Kilifi (Kenya). ENEL Foundation</h3>
    <p>The general objective of this study is to determine how to address the provision of universal access to modern energy services, as a contribution to the global energy model for the next decades. This project analyzes the trends in low-cost supply technologies, business models and enabling environment for modern heat and grid/off-grid electrification, and develops two in depth studies for the Andean region of Michiquillai in Cajamarca, Perú, and for the county of Kilifi in Kenya.</p>

    <h3>Mini-grids with Thermoacoustic Engine</h3>
    <p>The Thermo Acoustic Power System (TAPS) technology addresses the remote electrification challenge by providing clean, reliable, and maintenance-free power. The TAPS architecture is based on a thermoacoustic engine that improves the Stirling engine with enhanced flexibility and longevity. The architecture is modular in design and benefits from combining several engines to produce a scalable system. The objective of this study is evaluating technically and economically the TAPS technology in comparison to the current generation technologies, i.e. solar plus battery and diesel, in particular when the optimal electrification mode is either the microgrid or the standalone system.</p>

    <h3>Nigeria: Microgrid Designs with the World Bank, Odyssey Energy Solutions, REA, and General Electric</h3>
    <p>With research funding from General Electric, our team has been working with the World Bank, the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) – Nigeria, and Odyssey Energy Solutions to design microgrids for Nigeria using LREM. The work focuses on 100 sites within five states including Sokoto, Ogun, Cross River, Plateau, and Niger. We have used LREM to design both generation and network assets for each microgrid based on customized demand/equipment/cost inputs from REA. We are using LREM to produce a bill of materials and are collaborating with the Odyssey platform to provide detailed financial analyses for each microgrid and assess the economic viabilities of individual projects.</p>

    <h3>Spanish National R&D program: Challenges of Universal Access to modern energy, and their impact on climate change. Models to support decision-making.</h3>
    <p>The objective of this R&D project is the development of a tool-kit that facilitates that electrification agencies and governments of developing countries interact with private companies to define viable business models to provide universal energy access. To build strategies for universal access to energy services that are clean, reliable and affordable for cooking, heating, lighting, health, communications and productive uses requires tools that allow a careful assessment, centered in the diverse present and future needs of the beneficiaries and in their capacities, bringing together suitable innovative technologies, business initiatives, frontier financing and regulatory mechanisms according to the country strengths, to make use of the limited resources in an efficient manner.</p>
