    <h1>Research on Regulation and Business Models</h1>

    <p>The failure of the conventional power sector to provide universal electricity access in most developing countries has  number of well-understood causes. These are best understood in the broader context of a generalized failure to pursue liberalizing reforms now widely adopted in Europe, the Americas and Australia (Littlechild and Joskow 2006). Few developing countries have fully unbundled their utilities; private sector participation is often limited to independent power producers (IPPs); and wholesale and retail competition is generally absent. Instead, “hybrid power markets” have developed (Gratwick and Eberhard 2008; Eberhard and Godinho 2017; World Bank 2013), where incumbent state-owned utilities have retained dominant market positions and IPPs are introduced on the margin, i.e. both state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and IPPs are involved in new generation investments. A few countries have allowed the introduction of private capital and management in the distribution business, either via outright privatization, public private partnerships (PPP), or diverse types of franchises (World Bank 2017c; World Bank 2017d).</p>

    <p> The core challenges in these power systems are also well understood (Pérez-Arriaga 2017; World Bank 2017a; World Bank 2017b; World Bank 2017c; World Bank 2017d):</p>

    <ul>

        <li>The performance of utilities needs serious improvement. Inefficiencies in investment and operations, poor governance and few incentives for cost reduction lead to deterioration or collapse of services.</li>

        <li>Poor quality of service results in an adversarial relationship between the utility and its customers, which engenders illegal connections and unpaid bills, as well as a permissive attitude of the utilities and authorities with this kind of behavior. Politicians make use of subsidized tariffs to gain votes, leading customers to believe that they have right to inexpensive, or even free electricity, often effectuated via lax or unenforced collection policies.</li>

        <li>Capacity expansion and electrification need financing, but the public resources are insufficient, and private investment has to be accelerated. In addition, in general there is no clear assignment of responsibilities for planning, procurement and contracting.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>The regulatory measures that have to be applied are also apparent:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Independent regulation must be introduced to insulate tariff-setting from opportunistic political interventions, thus enabling cost-recovery and more predictable revenue streams.</li>

        <li>Effective planning, competitive procurement and contracting – critical for accelerating investment in large generation – must be implemented widely. Since wholesale market competition (i.e., competition within the market) is beyond reach in most developing countries, competition to enter the wholesale market (competition for the market) must be encouraged. This is presently also applicable to renewable generation, which can be now procured competitively.</li>

        <li>The performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) – distribution in particular, the weakest link in the supply chain – must be improved by incentive schemes, SOE governance reforms, clarification of roles and responsibilities, a more consumer-centered approach, and improved transparency and information; all of this would be greatly facilitated by changes in the ownership structure of the SOEs and their management, promoting the entry of private capital.</li>

        <li>Transmission, a natural monopoly, can attract private investment in a cost-efficient manner via auctions, but this requires legal security, a competent entity in charge of regional network planning – plus enforcement of the plan – and sound regulation, in particular regarding the allocation of costs of new investments.</li>

    </ul>

    <!--<p>There is no single approach to electrification. Until now the dominant pathway for providing electricity access has been through grid extension, which has been the source of the vast majority (97%) of new electricity connections since 2000 (IEA 2017). This requires coordinated developments of the complete chain of distribution, transmission and generation. However, rapidly declining costs of solar PV, battery technologies and energy efficient appliances are making decentralized renewable energy systems increasingly affordable, and often competitive with grid extension in rural and dispersed communities. Decentralized systems can also be attractive in areas with grid access but unreliable power supply. The opportunity to combine the three dominant modes of electrification – grid extension, mini-grid, and standalone solutions – increases the number of pathways available to attain electricity access. </p>-->

    <!--<p>A first insight, which reflects what is actually occurring in numerous countries, is the increasingly blurred line between the three electrification modes, whereby any of the three could be adopted depending on multiple circumstances, two or more modes may coexist for some consumers (typically one as a back-up for the poor reliability of other), and in other cases off-grid solutions may be a transitory bridge between total lack of access to electricity and the connection to a reliable central grid. Several electrification planning studies performed with our programmed Reference Electrification Model (REM) show how the mix of electrification modes in the lowest cost plan strongly depends on a large number of factors, such as the layout, capacity and reliability of the existing grid, the expected demand level, the topography, and the local price of diesel .</p>-->

    <!--<p>Needless to say, the regulatory designs must be tailored to the specific country circumstances. Further, countries must have certain characteristics to be able to attract substantial private investment, including: i) adequate governance, which includes both sound policy and regulation, legal security and functioning institutions; ii) some level of development in information and communication technologies (ICT); and iii) significant market potential – i.e., scale – for any of the business models related to electrification activities.</p>-->
