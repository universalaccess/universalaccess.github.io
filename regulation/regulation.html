    <h3>Spanish National R&D program: Challenges of Universal Access to modern energy, and their impact on climate change. Models to support decision-making.</h3>
    <p>The objective of this R&D project is the development of a tool-kit that facilitates that electrification agencies and governments of developing countries interact with private companies to define viable business models to provide universal energy access. To build strategies for universal access to energy services that are clean, reliable and affordable for cooking, heating, lighting, health, communications and productive uses requires tools that allow a careful assessment, centered in the diverse present and future needs of the beneficiaries and in their capacities, bringing together suitable innovative technologies, business initiatives, frontier financing and regulatory mechanisms according to the country strengths, to make use of the limited resources in an efficient manner.</p>
