    <h2>Global Commission to End Energy Poverty</h2>
    <p> The purpose of the Global Commission to End Energy Poverty is to forge an actionable consensus among leading investors, utilities, and policymakers that lays out a viable pathway for providing electricity services to hundreds of millions of under-served homes and businesses more quickly and more cost-effectively than the current trajectory. We stand at the cusp of a transformative moment in rural and last-mile productive-use electrification, where a coordinated approach to grid and off-grid planning and investment has the potential to unlock new public-private partnerships that can dramatically bend the curve on ending energy poverty. The Commission also explores opportunities in East and West Africa to promote cooperation on regional power trading as a means of helping to mitigate supply interruptions, take advantage of economies of scale, improve efficiency of dispatch, and ultimately reduce the cost of wholesale energy. The Commission comprises high-ranking representatives from the energy sectors of several African and Asian countries, along with investors, multilateral development banks, academics, and the leaders of utilities, and off-grid firms. It operates under the joint chairmanship of The Rockefeller Foundation President Dr. Rajiv J. Shah; former U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest J. Moniz, special advisor to the MIT President and the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems emeritus at MIT; and Africa Development Bank President Akinwumi Adisina. They oversee the work of a research team led by MIT visiting professor Ignacio Perez-Arriaga and MIT Energy Initiative Deputy Director Robert Stoner—who will also serve as the secretary of the Commission. See <a href="https://www.endenergypoverty.org/">https://www.endenergypoverty.org/</a> </p>

    <p> Presently, most of the Commission efforts are focused on developing and implementing an approach, termed the Integrated Distribution Framework (IDF), which seeks to address the existing problems that cripple incumbent distribution utilities and discourage any further electrification efforts. The distribution viability challenges hinder the mobilization of the substantial public and, mostly, private investment needed to invest in networks to improve reliability of supply and to expand new connections. </p>


    <p> Under the IDF, new business models for distribution can be developed that leave-no-one-behind, ensure permanence of supply, integrate the various electrification modes (on-grid and off-grid), and are aligned with the long-term development of the power sector. The IDF is built around the idea of an entity – public, private or a partnership – that is responsible for undertaking distribution activities in a given territory via a concession – thus, privatization is not necessary – and with a mandate to deliver universal access within its service area by using an appropriate mix of electrification modes with a viable business plan supported by cost of service regulation, viability gap funding and adequate risk mitigation. Implementation of IDF is presently under discussion in several “first action countries”.</p>

    <h2>Electricity Access: Scoping the Energy Company of the Future (ECoF)</h2>
    <p>The project was developed by MIT in collaboration with Comillas University, during the second half of 2017 and first half of 2018, and it has focused on the development of the core concept of the approach: the regulatory and business model of the energy company of the future. Other institutions – mainly Systemiq / Climate Policy Initiative, focusing on the financial aspects, and Skaden, on the legal ones – have also participated. The work has been guided by an Advisory Group, chaired by the Shell Foundation Director, with participation from policy makers, investors, practitioners and existing incumbents, including, among others, AFDB, World Bank, Globeleq, Shell, Ecofin and Tata Power.</p>
    <p>The lack of access to electricity by a large number of people in many low-income and developing countries is a major contemporary issue, with social, ethical, environmental and technical dimensions. It is a major challenge for the global energy sector, and it may also be an interesting business opportunity.</p>
    <p>The objective of the project was to define a viable large-scale business model, to be deployed in one or more suitable developing countries, which would accelerate electricity access and be attractive for corporate investment.</p>
    <p>The incumbent power companies of many developing countries have not been able to deliver access or acceptable levels of service. In this project, we concentrated on the preliminary definition of a leading, profitable and integrated energy company, focused on developing markets, serving all consumers, with a consumer centric approach, making extensive use of digitization and other advanced technologies, and providing the necessary long-term resources to achieve global scale.</p>
    <p>We believe that this business model does not exist yet, and a new one will have to be created – the energy company of the future (ECoF). Defining the ECoF was the objective of the project. It has required fresh thinking, the creation of a business that integrates the strengths and key components of a range of organizations, adequately uses advanced technologies and approaches the engagement with customers in novel and proactive ways.</p>
    <p>We looked into the factors leading to the lack of electricity access and have singled out the areas where serious investment is needed and examined the associated business models, we have identified where the core problem appears to be, and we have proposed a business model approach – the ECoF – that, based on past experiences and some innovative ideas, could address the existing problems that cripple the incumbent utilities and prevent serious investment.</p>
    <p>In agreement with many experts, we have concluded that the distribution activity is at the core of the electrification deficit. However, despite the many difficulties experienced today, and because of its present shortcomings, distribution offers multiple possibilities for innovation in management, technology, regulation and consumer engagement. Therefore, distribution has been the focus of the proposed approach to the ECoF. The structure and scope of the company should be adapted and implemented differently in each country. A consortium or partnership of several companies with complementary profiles might be needed to address the required scale in size and scope.</p>
    <p>The entry of private participation in the incumbent distribution utility may offer a good opportunity to change the (frequently negative) perception that the customers have today of their electricity supplier and augment their willingness to pay. Advanced technologies can be used in multiple ways to advance electricity access. Besides the efficient appliances, and the cost reduction and enhanced performance of photovoltaics and batteries that are behind the rapid growth of off-grid electrification, advanced computational techniques can support electrification planning, power electronics and distributed computation can facilitate the interplay of on- and off-grid systems, and information and communication technologies (ICT) can substantially enhance the functions of system operation, bill collection, dynamic pricing, issue diagnosis, customer service, and theft detection.</p>
    <p>In parallel with the search for the definition of the ECoF, we have screened the developing countries with a significant lack of electrification and, based on some pre-established criteria, we have selected a reduced set of countries where – in a first approximation – it makes the most sense to try the implementation of the proposed business model. The search for the most attractive countries to invest in electrification activities has been based on three major global indicators: i) adequate governance, which includes both sound policy and regulation, legal security and functioning institutions; ii) the level of development in information and communication technologies (ICT); and iii) some global estimation of the market potential for business models devoted to electrification activities.</p>
    <p>We have proposed an approach (the ECoF), that tries to overcome the major limitations of the model that is present in most developing countries and pursues some key societal objectives: i) acceleration of the electrification process while guaranteeing that it will reach everybody with a planned incremental strategy; this will require the growth of connections to the main grid or to mini-grids, and support for the purchase of solar home systems when this is the most cost-effective option ii) efficient use of resources, minimizing duplication and waste; iii) reduction of the financial risk – and the cost of capital, as a consequence – for the expensive investment in and operation of network assets; iv) creation of a positive relationship of collaboration with the customers, making use of local expertise, leading to reduction of theft and unpaid bills; v) improvement of the technical and commercial quality of service; vi) leverage electrification to promote productive uses of electricity, and vii) make use of customer relationships to enter adjacent markets, such as ICT, agro-marketing, retailing of non-electrical goods, or banking.</p>
    <p>The ECoF is built around the concept of an enhanced distribution utility that we shall term the “Integrated Distribution Company” (IDC). The ECoF is the IDC, plus other features that might be added depending on the circumstances, and that will be described later. The key elements of the IDC are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The distribution activity is defined as a zonal concession,<sup>1</sup> i.e. a company with the obligation of electricity supply to all existing and potential customers in the assigned territory, by any electrification mode.</li>
        <li>Substantial private participation in the ownership and management of the incumbent distribution utility.</li>
        <li>Recognition of the different capability requirements and risk profile of the mostly-infrastructure and mostly-consumer centered business models.</li>
        <li>Focus on a more integrated and consumer-centered approach.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to and reinforcing these essential reforms are other measures that may be of a more conventional nature, but are equally necessary to achieve the desired objective of accelerating the universal electrification process with a viable ECoF:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Integrated Distribution Company (IDC) may be enhanced by integrating into the same business model other major electricity supply activities, such as generation or transmission.</li>
        <li>Exploit the several existing opportunities to reduce the viability gap by improving the efficiency of the distribution company and increasing its revenues.</li>
        <li>Focus on and give priority to electrification projects associated to productive uses of electricity.</li>
        <li>Engage in additional activities that may improve the economic viability of the company.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scaling up Energy Investments in Africa for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth</h2>

    <p>Providing universal, reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy access offers the opportunity to empower the people in Africa to decide the course of their lives through education, health and economic development. Africa is not on track to provide universal electricity access—to meet SDG 7—in the coming decade. Almost 600 million people will still lack access to electricity by 2030 in the absence of major changes (representing 90% of the total estimated population without access globally). Sub-Saharan Africa faces a set of challenges in the next decades, especially related to accelerating population growth, poverty eradication, climate change and environmental degradation. Moreover, the continent faces an urgent social, economic and environmental crisis in the lack of access to clean cooking. The clean cooking sector remains stunted, with 900 million people (over 80% of the population) lacking access to clean cooking solutions, including 70% in urban areas. As Africa’s closest geographic neighbour, Europe is uniquely positioned to support the continent in addressing these challenges.</p>
    <p>The Africa-Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs<sup>1</sup> launched in 2018 works to address key challenges in employment and inequality in Africa. A year after its launch, four Sectoral Task Forces on agriculture, energy, digital economy and transport, were set up as thematic platforms for high-level policy dialogue, and have brought together experts, politicians, academics and private sector from both continents. The Alliance’s Energy Task Force, named the Africa-Europe High Level Platform for Sustainable Energy Investments (SEI Platform) has worked since April 2019 to produce a report to guide the future activities of Alliance in energy. This report was presented at the Africa Investment Forum in Johannesburg, on November 2019.<sup>2</sup> Professor Ignacio Pérez-Arriaga has led the Task Force working group on regulation and has been a major contributor to the content of the report.</p>
    <p>The report focuses on solutions to the climate and energy access crisis in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), to achieve universal access to energy by 2030 and to support an energy transition for sustainable development. It recommends an integrated approach to distribution, enhancing regional electricity trade, and facilitating increased investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean cooking investments. A new distribution model that brings together on- and off-grid distribution services under an integrated distribution framework is proposed, to leave no one behind. Reinforcing transmission and power pools for greater regional integration are key elements of this transition.</p>
    <p>The energy market landscape in Africa offers an array of opportunities for investments and partnerships in sustainable and renewable generation technologies, as well as in energy efficiency, transmission networks and various distribution models. Strengthening grids and extending connections to new customers (both through central grids and off-grid systems) offer additional areas of investment opportunities. The cooking sector needs to scale up investments dramatically to meet universal clean cooking access by 2030. Such investments stand to benefit Africa and the entire world.</p>
    <p>Several obstacles stand in the way of rapid electricity access expansion in sub-Saharan Africa. Power utilities face financial deficits across the continent. Investment levels in bulk (utility-scale) generation and transmission infrastructure remain lower than for any other region, especially due to higher risks and reliance on ad hoc, piecemeal interventions. This highlights the needs to reduce risks, to make sure existing project development methods are effective and efficient, and to create scale economies for electricity generation and transmission through power pools. Investment is most sorely needed in the last mile to serve remote, rural communities. Maintaining and extending the pace of progress will require strong political commitment and sound governance, long-term energy planning, adequate political and fiscal incentives as well as public and private financing.</p>
    <p>The report makes recommendations in eleven categories, divided into two sets. The first set addresses four transversal matters necessary to shape an enabling environment to drive the sustainable energy transition: i) policy and regulations, ii) project implementation instruments, iii) financing and fiscal measures, and iv) capacity building. The second set addresses topics related to specific segments of the energy sector: a) traditional distribution, b) the off-grid sector, c) transmission, d) generation, e) regional integration through power pools, f) energy efficiency, and g) clean cooking.</p>

    <h2>Spanish National R&D program: Challenges of Universal Access to modern energy, and their impact on climate change. Models to support decision-making.</h2>
    <p>The objective of this R&D project is the development of a tool-kit that facilitates that electrification agencies and governments of developing countries interact with private companies to define viable business models to provide universal energy access. To build strategies for universal access to energy services that are clean, reliable and affordable for cooking, heating, lighting, health, communications and productive uses requires tools that allow a careful assessment, centered in the diverse present and future needs of the beneficiaries and in their capacities, bringing together suitable innovative technologies, business initiatives, frontier financing and regulatory mechanisms according to the country strengths, to make use of the limited resources in an efficient manner.</p>

    <h2>Research on Governance and Rules of the Southern Africa Power Pool (SAPP)</h2>
    <p>Power pools can reduce the cost of providing electricity and improve system reliability through coordinated use of energy resources. Realizing these benefits requires careful market design supported by technical, economic and institutional analysis of the system as it exists today and as it will likely evolve in the future. This MIT doctoral dissertation by Amy Rose<sup>1</sup>, supervised by Ignacio Pérez-Arriaga and Robert Stoner, demonstrates this integrated approach through a detailed study of the design and operation of the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP). The thesis develops a linear programming model of the SAPP system that explicitly represents hourly system operations to conduct this analysis. This model is then adapted through the addition of new input parameters or linear constraints to investigate different market design questions including how to implement bilateral contracts in the wholesale market and allocate costs for regional transmission investments. The thesis also examines the design of regional institutions and their role to promote efficient investments and market behavior.</p>
    <p>The primary contributions from this work include a new method to design and incorporate security-motivated bilateral contracts into wholesale markets using Implicit Auctions with Security of Supply Guarantees; a regulatory framework for transmission planning and cost allocation designed specifically for supranational regional markets; a quantitative comparison of transmission pricing methods leading to recommendations to apply Beneficiary Pays for new lines and Average Participations for existing lines; recommended adjustments to transmission regulation to facilitate increased penetrations of renewable energy; and a proposed design for the regional regulator. The thesis also identifies several unique features of developing country power systems that may influence market design. Other markets in Africa, Asia and Central America contain similar technical and institutional characteristics that can lead to similar market challenges. The specific market rules and implementation steps developed for the SAPP may not apply in all regions, but the integrated approach used in this thesis, combining technical models and institutional analysis to support regulatory decisions, could be generalized to other regional electricity markets.</p>
    <p>To better understand how an integrated approach to regional market design can be used to address the unique opportunities and challenges present in developing countries, the thesis develops a package of proposed regulatory measures tailored to the specific case of the SAPP. This dissertation is not designed to be a comprehensive study of every aspect of market design but focuses on key issues identified as common challenges in regional markets. Specifically, this dissertation addresses the following research questions:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>How can regional market rules promote efficient use of resources while ensuring security of supply?</li>
        <li>What institutional arrangements, planning processes and network cost allocation mechanisms are needed to promote necessary investments in regional transmission infrastructure?</li>
        <li>What should the primary responsibilities of the regional regulator and national regulators be to support the efficient functioning of the market?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Any recommendations must be consistent with sound economic and regulatory theory and include two important elements. First, major regulatory changes are likely to be in place for many years and must be based on a broad, long-term perspective and not designed to just solve short term problems. Second, any workable recommendations should include a discussion of possible transition paths to get from the status quo to the proposed change. In this second element, the proposed solutions may not be fully generalizable to other markets because actual implementation steps will depend on the market being studied.</p>
